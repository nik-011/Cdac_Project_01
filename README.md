•	Incorporated PySpark for Data preprocessing of 80000+ rows in the dataset 

•	Implemented Natural Language Processing (NLP) for reviews classification and analysis, employed K-Means for clustering to create 4 clusters 

•	Utilized Recommender System Machine Learning Algorithm for recommending the schools having correlation greater than 0.5 with the expectations of the User.

•	Created a tableau dashboard.
